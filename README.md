# Introduction
The No Show dataset was us used for analysis. This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. The dataset majors on the chances of patients showing up for an appointment given the many features that may affect it

# Tools
Jupyter Notebook, Python
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

# Dataset source
The datset can be found here; https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments.

# Conclusions
Even though there are several factors that appear to have an impact on patients missing appointments, investigation research revealed that none of them had an overall significant effect on this; However we can coclude that, Women are more likely to visit the hospital than men as they made up a bigger percentage of the population that visits the hospital. Majority of the patients also show up on their appointment day
